# MIT-Bloggers
# Mini Project 2

Problem Statement - <br>
Everything is going online due to the pandemic. Because of this, students cannot interact with other students like their seniors. <br>
And in college days interaction with seniors and other students is necessary to share knowledge and also for self-growth. We can’t <br> 
physically interact with each other, but we can interact with others virtually and share knowledge. <br>
So we came up with an idea to build a platform for our MIT SOE engineering students to share their knowledge of their expertise field in the form of a blog. <br><br>

Solution - <br>
Using web development we have planned to make a ‘Blog Website’ named ‘MIT Blogger’ where students from the first year to last year <br>
can post a blog, like, and comment on other blogs by creating an account on the website using their Enrollment Number. It would be <br>
just like a social media platform but only for blogs of SOE students. <br>
The main purpose of creating this website is that it can be a way of communication or interaction between students of different years <br>
and different fields. <br>
The project is designed using various languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Apart from this, we have also used the Django framework. <br>
We have used Visual Studio Code as an IDE. Currently, we have build this website only for SOE students as of now. If this project turns <br>
out to be successful we would add other features through which other college students can also use this website.
