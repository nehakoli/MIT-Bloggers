# MIT-Bloggers
# Mini Project 2

Problem Statement - <br>
Everything is going online due to the pandemic. Because of this, students cannot interact with other students like their seniors. and in college days interaction with seniors and other students is necessary to share knowledge and also for self-growth. We can’t physically interact with each other, but we can interact with others virtually and share knowledge.
So we came up with an idea to build a platform for our MIT SOE engineering students to share their knowledge of their expertise field in the form of a blog. 

Solution - <br>
Using web development we have planned to make a ‘Blog Website’ named ‘MIT Blogger’ where students from the first year to last year can post a blog, 
like, and comment on other blogs by creating an account on the website using their Enrollment Number. It would be just like a social media platform 
but only for blogs of SOE students.
The main purpose of creating this website is that it can be a way of communication or interaction between students of different years and different fields. 
The project will be designed using various languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Apart from this, we will also be using the Django framework. We will 
be using Visual Studio Code as an IDE. Currently, we are building this website only for SOE students. If this project turns out to be successful we would 
add other features through which other branch students can also use this website.
